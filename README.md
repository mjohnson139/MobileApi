# Mobile API Control Pattern

A proof of concept project demonstrating an embedded HTTP server pattern within mobile applications for automated testing and quality assurance.

## Overview

This project implements a novel approach to mobile app testing by embedding an HTTP API server directly within the mobile application. This pattern enables external QA tools and test runners to interact with the app programmatically, providing real-time state inspection, UI action automation, and comprehensive testing capabilities.

## 📱 Live Demonstrations

**[View Screenshots of Working PoC](poc/POC_SCREENSHOTS.md)**

See the Mobile API Control Pattern in action with live screenshots showing:
- React Native app with embedded Express.js server running
- Real-time API responses and state management
- Redux state visualization with performance metrics
- Complete integration flow from UI to API

## Key Features

- **Embedded HTTP Server**: Lightweight API server running within the mobile app
- **RESTful API**: Clean, intuitive endpoints for state management and action control
- **Real-time State Access**: Live inspection and modification of application state
- **UI Action Automation**: Programmatic control of user interface interactions
- **Smart Home Demo**: Interactive control panel showcasing lights and switches
- **Token-based Security**: Secure API access with enable/disable capabilities

## Architecture

The system follows an embedded server pattern with the following core components:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   QA Tool/      │    │  Mobile App     │    │   App UI        │
│   Test Runner   │◄──►│  API Server     │◄──►│   Components    │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
                       ┌─────────────────┐
                       │  State Manager  │
                       │  & Command      │
                       │  Processor      │
                       └─────────────────┘
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /state` - Retrieve current application state
- `POST /state` - Update application state
- `POST /actions/{type}` - Execute UI actions
- `GET /screenshot` - Capture current screen
- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate API access
- `GET /health` - Server health check
