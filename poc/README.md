# Proof of Concept Implementations

This directory contains proof of concept implementations for the key technologies selected in the Mobile API Control Pattern technology stack.

## Overview

These implementations validate the feasibility and integration of the selected technologies:

1. **React Native with Express.js** - Embedded HTTP server
2. **Redux State Management** - Centralized state management
3. **JWT Authentication** - Security implementation
4. **Screenshot Capture** - react-native-view-shot integration

## Running the Proof of Concepts

Each subdirectory contains a focused implementation that can be run independently to validate specific technology integrations and performance characteristics.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- React Native development environment
- iOS Simulator and/or Android Emulator

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to specific PoC directory
cd poc/[poc-name]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the proof of concept
npm start
```

## Performance Benchmarks

Each PoC includes performance benchmarking to validate the technical requirements:

- Server startup time
- API response latency
- Memory usage
- Screenshot capture performance

## Implementation Guidelines

These PoCs serve as implementation reference for the full project development, demonstrating:

- Best practices for technology integration
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security implementation patterns
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations
