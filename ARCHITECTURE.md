# System Architecture

## Overview

The Mobile API Control Pattern implements an embedded HTTP server pattern within mobile applications, enabling external tools to interact with the app programmatically for testing, automation, and quality assurance purposes.

## Architectural Pattern

### Embedded API Server Pattern

The core architectural pattern involves embedding a lightweight HTTP server directly within the mobile application. This server provides RESTful endpoints that expose the application's internal state and allow external systems to trigger actions.

**Key Benefits:**
- Real-time access to application state
- Programmatic control of UI interactions
- Seamless integration with existing QA workflows
- No need for external testing frameworks or complicated setup

### Component Details

#### 1. Mobile App API Server
- **Purpose**: Embedded HTTP server running within the mobile application
- **Technology**: Lightweight HTTP server (implementation TBD)
- **Port**: Configurable port (default: 8080)
- **Security**: Token-based authentication with enable/disable capability

#### 2. App UI Components
- **Purpose**: Standard mobile app user interface
- **Integration**: Connected to state manager for real-time updates
- **Demo Concept**: Smart Home Control Panel with interactive elements
  - Light switches (on/off states)
  - Dimmer controls
  - Temperature controls
  - Status indicators

#### 3. State Manager & Command Processor
- **Purpose**: Central hub for application state and command execution
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Maintain current application state
  - Process incoming API commands
  - Update UI components based on state changes
  - Execute UI actions programmatically

#### 4. QA Tool/Test Runner
- **Purpose**: External testing and automation tools
- **Communication**: HTTP REST API calls to embedded server
- **Capabilities**:
  - Query current application state
  - Trigger UI actions
  - Capture screenshots
  - Automate test scenarios

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Pattern Selection: Embedded HTTP Server
**Decision**: Embed HTTP server within mobile app rather than using external testing frameworks

**Rationale**:
- Direct access to application internals
- Real-time state synchronization
- Simplified setup and integration
- Platform-agnostic approach

**Trade-offs**:
- Additional resource usage in production
- Security considerations for API access
- Need for proper server lifecycle management

### 2. API Design: RESTful Architecture
**Decision**: Use RESTful HTTP endpoints for API interface

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard approach
- Easy integration with existing tools
- Language and platform agnostic
- Well-understood patterns and conventions

### 3. Authentication: Token-based Security
**Decision**: Implement token-based authentication with enable/disable capability

**Rationale**:
- Secure API access control
- Ability to disable in production builds
- Simple implementation and integration
- Flexible authorization schemes

### 4. State Management: Centralized Store
**Decision**: Use centralized state management pattern

**Rationale**:
- Single source of truth for application state
- Simplified state synchronization between UI and API
- Easier testing and debugging
- Consistent state updates across components

### 5. UI Concept: Smart Home Control Panel
**Decision**: Implement smart home control panel as demo application

**Rationale**:
- Rich interactive elements for testing
- Clear visual feedback for state changes
- Realistic use case demonstration
- Variety of control types (switches, sliders, etc.)

## Data Flow

### 1. State Query Flow
```
QA Tool → GET /state → API Server → State Manager → JSON Response
```

### 2. State Update Flow
```
QA Tool → POST /state → API Server → State Manager → UI Update
```

### 3. Action Execution Flow
```
QA Tool → POST /actions/{type} → API Server → Command Processor → UI Action → State Update
```

### 4. Screenshot Capture Flow
```
QA Tool → GET /screenshot → API Server → Screen Capture → Image Response
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Token-based API access control
- Configurable enable/disable for production builds
- Secure token generation and validation
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

### Network Security
- Local network access only (no external exposure)
- HTTPS support for encrypted communication
- Configurable network interfaces and ports

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data exposure through API
- Audit logging for API access
- State sanitization for external access

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- Minimal impact on app performance
- Lightweight HTTP server implementation
- Efficient state serialization
- Configurable server lifecycle

### Scalability
- Single-threaded server model
- Connection pooling for multiple clients
- Asynchronous request handling where possible

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Mobile Platform**: To be determined (iOS/Android/Cross-platform)
- **HTTP Server**: Lightweight embedded server library
- **State Management**: Platform-specific state management solution
- **Authentication**: JWT or similar token-based system

### Integration Technologies
- **REST API**: Standard HTTP/JSON communication
- **Screenshot Capture**: Platform-specific screen capture APIs
- **Network Communication**: Standard HTTP client libraries

## Future Considerations

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for custom endpoints
- Configurable action types and handlers
- Custom state serialization formats

### Platform Support
- Multi-platform implementation strategy
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Shared core architecture across platforms

### Advanced Features
- Real-time state streaming via WebSockets
- Video recording capabilities
- Advanced debugging and profiling endpoints
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Implementation Phases

This architecture will be implemented in phases as outlined in the [Project Plan](PROJECT_PLAN.md), starting with core server functionality and basic state management, then adding advanced features and platform-specific optimizations.
