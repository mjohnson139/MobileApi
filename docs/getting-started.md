# Getting Started Guide

## Overview

This guide helps you get started with the Mobile API Control Pattern project, from understanding the concepts to setting up your development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning development, ensure you have:

- Understanding of mobile app development principles
- Experience with RESTful APIs
- Basic knowledge of HTTP servers and networking
- Familiarity with your chosen mobile development platform

## Project Structure

```

├── ARCHITECTURE.md           # System architecture
├── API.md                   # API specification

├── docs/                    # Additional documentation
└── [Future: src/, tests/, examples/]
```

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Understanding the Architecture
1. Read the [README.md](../README.md) for project overview
2. Study the [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design
3. Review the [API.md](../API.md) for API specifications
4. Check the [PROJECT_PLAN.md](../PROJECT_PLAN.md) for development phases

### Phase 2: Technology Selection
- Research mobile development platforms
- Evaluate HTTP server libraries
- Choose state management solutions
- Select authentication frameworks

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Set up development environment
- Implement core components
- Build API endpoints
- Create user interface

## Key Concepts

### Embedded HTTP Server Pattern
The core pattern involves running a lightweight HTTP server within your mobile application, enabling external tools to interact with the app programmatically.

### State Management
Centralized state store that maintains the current application state and synchronizes between the UI and API.

### Smart Home Demo
An interactive control panel demonstrating lights, switches, and controls that can be manipulated both through the UI and API.

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Read all documentation files
- [ ] Understand the architecture pattern
- [ ] Review API endpoints and specifications
- [ ] Check project timeline and phases
- [ ] Identify your role and responsibilities
- [ ] Set up development environment (when Phase 2 begins)

## Next Steps

1. Review the GitHub issues for current development tasks
2. Participate in technology selection discussions
3. Begin implementation according to project phases
4. Contribute to documentation improvements
